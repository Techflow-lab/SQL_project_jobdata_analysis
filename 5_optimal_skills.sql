-- Highest Demand (Foundation): SQL (398 postings, $\text{avg\_salary} = \$97,237$) is the single most required skill, making it essential for job volume and security.
-- Highest Salary (Specialization): Specialized data warehouse and cloud skills command the highest pay: Snowflake ($\$112,948$), Azure ($\$111,225$), and AWS ($\$108,317$).
-- Visualization: Tableau (230 postings, $\text{avg\_salary} = \$99,288$) is the leading visualization tool by demand.
-- Conclusion: Prioritize SQL (demand) and Python/R (optimal balance), then add a visualization tool (Tableau) and a specialization (Snowflake) to maximize both job access and earning potential.
